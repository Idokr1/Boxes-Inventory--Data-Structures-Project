# Data Structures Project
The application is designed to optimize storage efficiency by employing two linked generics data structures - a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Doubly Linked List. The program facilitates the management of a box storage facility, allowing users to perform various operations such as adding, removing, and obtaining the best offer for square-bottomed boxes, which are represented by their width (X), length (X), and height (Y).

## Binary Search Tree:
My generic Binary Search Tree (BST) is designed to perform efficient searching and retrieval operations. The BST utilizes a generic key and value structure, enabling the storage of complex data while maintaining optimal performance in terms of insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. Additionally, I have implemented an efficient search algorithm that can locate elements with minimum and maximum values.
