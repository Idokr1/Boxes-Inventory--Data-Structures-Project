# Data Structures Project
The application is designed to optimize storage efficiency by employing two linked generics data structures - a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Doubly Linked List. The program facilitates the management of a box storage facility, allowing users to perform various operations such as adding, removing, and obtaining the best offer for square-bottomed boxes, which are represented by their width (X), length (X), and height (Y).
